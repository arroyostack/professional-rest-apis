# REST APIs with Flask and Python

This repository contains the notes and REST APIs that I created by following the course "REST APIs with Flask and Python in 2023" by [Jose salvatierra](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/ ) .



## This course teaches how to:

* Create REST APIs with Flask
* Use SQLAlchemy to connect to a database
* Test REST APIs with Postman
* Deploy REST APIs to Docker containers
* Use flask-smorest to create a swagger UI for your REST APIs
* Use the command line to interact with your REST APIs



## Getting started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, run the Dockerfile:
```
docker build -t rest-apis-flask-python 
```

## Happy days :sunny:
